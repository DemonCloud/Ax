### Ax is a fast MV JavaScript Framework. 

It require `Struct` utils lib, for the sake of better organization application structure with modular architecture( **AMD or CommonJS specification** ). This is not to replace `Backbone` or `Angular` etc, maybe it boring form of entertainment. Of course, it can cooperate with `React` & `Vue` very well.

## The Ax design target

* **model** - immutable, fast, persistence, safety
* **view** - simple, fast, container, virtualDOM
* **route** - simple, parameterized, hashonly (will delete in 4.0)
* **atom** - connector, fast, independent

## Install

use **npm** or **yarn** install `ax` and `struct`

```shell
npm install ax-js
npm install ax-struct-js
```

## Prepare Feature VERSION 4.0+

1. Remove `route` from `ax` , just focus `model` `view` and `atom`
2. `model` extend more useful API, as `model.lock`
3. `atom` more fast with use `struct` connect
