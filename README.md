Ax is a fast MVR JavaScript Framework. 

It require `Struct` utils lib, for the sake of better organization application structure with modular architecture( **AMD or CommonJS specification** ). This is not to replace `Backbone` or `Angular` etc, maybe it boring form of entertainment. Of course, it can cooperate with `React` very well.
