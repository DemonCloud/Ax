## The Fast MV JavaScript Framework. 

It require `Struct` utils lib, for the sake of better organization application structure with modular architecture( **AMD or CommonJS specification** ). This is not to replace `Backbone` or `Angular` etc, maybe it boring form of entertainment. Of course, it can cooperate with `React` & `Vue` very well.

## The Ax design target

* **model** - immutable, fast, persistence, safety
* **view** - simple, fast, container, virtualDOM
* **atom** - connector, fast, independent
